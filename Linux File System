The Linux Filesystem

The directories you will find most useful are:

    /bin - basic programs (ls, cd, cat, etc.)
    /sbin - system programs (fdisk, mkfs, sysctl, etc)
    /etc - configuration files
    /tmp - temporary files (typically deleted on boot)
    /usr/bin - applications (apt, ncat, nmap, etc.)
    /usr/share - application support and data files
